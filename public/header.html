        The problem we are looking to fix is that donating to charities online isn’t a
        streamlined process. We want to make donating to charity as easy as ordering from
        amazon while making sure the quality of charities receiving this money is worthy
        of our users money. Our system will make it easy for our users to find a charity
        that resembles what our user would like to support, let the user know where their
        money is going, and make it a easy payment process.
